# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:
  # The normal (roman) font face to use.
  # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
  normal:
    family: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono 
    style: Light
    # family: "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono"
    # family: "Source Code Pro"
    # style: Retina

  # The bold font face
  bold:
    family: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono 
    style: Medium
    # family: "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono"
    # family: "Source Code Pro"

  # The italic font face
  italic:
    family: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono 
    style: "Light Italic"
    # style: "Light Oblique"
    # family: "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono"
    # family: "Source Code Pro"
    # style: "Medium Italic"

  # Point size of the font
  size: 16.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. offset.y can be thought of
  # as modifying the linespacing, and offset.x as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increase the x offset to move the glyph to
  # the right, increase the y offset to move the glyph upward.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina you
  # probably want this set to false.
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
